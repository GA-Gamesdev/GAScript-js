## this is GA2D



the next project in the GAScript.js library will be a 2d rendering engine,



right now, the engine will be taking a longer time compared to the other smaller pieces of the library,



you can create a GA2D canvas using the html.js 



GA2Dcanvas() is what needs to be run



thats about it....



##### plans for the project



make a simple 2d rendering engine that will be compatible with the rest of the GAScript library



this project aims to make canvas rendering easier. (i hope...)



##### when will the project be completed



i hope to complete the project soonish



##### what will i be able to use this project for?



making simple images and games with GAScript.js code



welp...

that's all i got to say
